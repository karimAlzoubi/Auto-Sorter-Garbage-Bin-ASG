# Auto-Sorter Garbage Bin (ASG) Project

## Overview
<p>The Auto-Sorter Garbage Bin (ASG) is an innovative solution designed to enhance waste management through automated sorting. Utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology and intelligent sensors, this project aims to separate waste into different categories efficiently, promoting recycling ♻️ and sustainability 🌍.<p>

## Features:
<p>Automated Sorting: The ASG system employs advanced sensors to identify and categorize waste into different types, including plastic 🥤, paper 📄, and metal 🥫.<p>
<p>Automatic Opening and Closing: The bin opens automatically when a person approaches 🚶‍♂️ and closes when they leave, ensuring convenience and hygiene.<p>
<p>Compact Design: The bin is designed to fit in various environments, making it suitable for homes 🏠, offices 🏢, and public spaces 🌳.<p>
<p>Sustainability Focus: The project promotes recycling and proper waste segregation to contribute positively to the environment 🌱.<p>


## Technologies Used:
<p>Microcontroller: Arduino for controlling sensors and actuators 🛠️.<p>
<p>Sensors:<p>
<p>  **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Measures distance and detects nearby objects 📏.<p>
<p>  **IR Sensor**: Used to detect paper 📄 and plastic 🥤 waste.<p>
<p>  **Servo Motor:** Moves sorting mechanisms to categorize waste ⚙️.<p>
<p>  **Proximity Sensor:** Detects and identifies metal 🥫 waste.<p>
